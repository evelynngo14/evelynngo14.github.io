i learned that i *do not need to use a react library* to create dropdown menus. modern css and html work perfectly fine to create the foundation of simple components

this is also something i learned with datepickers for my event planning project, i thought i needed a library for that too, but a 'datelocal-time' HTML element worked well for my use.
javascript would then be used to handle user interactions such as opening and closing the dropdown menu and sending data to the server. a major motivator for this outlook was reading through [Pikaday](https://pikaday.dbushell.com/), a guide to user-friendly frontend date pickers that forgoes javascript and the need for complex ui.

knowing the foundational capabilities of modern css and html helps with creating reusable and accessible components without the complexity of a library, which is useful
when you are just starting to learn development. it can be distracting trying to search for libraries when you can just use the browser's native capabilities.

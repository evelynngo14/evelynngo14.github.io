i coded the retro computer window from scratch, but it took forever to get it looking how i wanted it to! i found a few websites that were life-savers for helping me visualize my layouts and understand what i was doing.  

i found good results by using a grid layout with a fixed width and height for each cell using absolute positioning. elements like the scroll bar and chevron arrows had to be manually positioned using top / right / bottom / left utilities. hopefully once i'm able to optimize the code i'll consider sharing it as a react component.
